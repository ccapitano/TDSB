What are the three longest trips on rainy days?
WITH
    trip_dates
AS (
   SELECT
        trip_id,
		duration,
		zip_code,
		DATE(start_date) tdt
    FROM
        trips
)
	, weather_dates
AS (
	SELECT
		Date(date) dt,
		events,
		zip
	FROM
		weather
	WHERE
		events LIKE '%Rain%'
)

SELECT
    trip_dates.trip_id,
    trip_dates.duration,
    weather_dates.dt
FROM
    trip_dates
JOIN
    weather_dates
ON
    trip_dates.tdt = weather_dates.dt AND 
	trip_dates.zip_code = weather_dates.zip
ORDER BY trip_dates.duration DESC
LIMIT 3
;

Which station is full most often?
SELECT 
	station_id,
	count(timestamp) cnt
FROM status
WHERE docks_available = bikes_available
GROUP BY station_id
ORDER BY cnt DESC
LIMIT 1

Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting at that station but ordered by dock count.
SELECT 
	stations.name,
	stations.dockcount,
	count(trips.start_station) cnt
FROM stations
LEFT JOIN trips
ON stations.name = trips.start_station
GROUP BY stations.name, stations.dockcount
ORDER BY stations.dockcount

(Challenge) What's the length of the longest trip for each day it rains anywhere?
WITH rain_dates AS (
SELECT 
	Date(date) dt
FROM weather
WHERE events = 'Rain'
GROUP BY dt),
long_trip AS (
SELECT
	DATE(start_date) sdt,
	MAX(duration) longest
FROM trips
GROUP BY sdt)
SELECT
	long_trip.sdt,
	long_trip.longest
FROM long_trip
JOIN rain_dates
ON long_trip.sdt = rain_dates.dt
