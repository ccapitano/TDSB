Problem statement:  Identify whether Jar Jar or Windu are the better at promoting favorable feelings toward the Jedi.  
There are eight planets available for polling.  Four of the planets are already favorably inclined to the Jedi and four are not.
Solution:  To find the best representative, send each to two planets in favor and two that are not.  Compare the increase in favorability
from each set of planets (favorably inclined vs not).
Method of testing:  Survey the residents of the planets obtaining rankings of favorable feelings toward the Jedi before and
after the visits.  Compare the change in favorability generated by Jar Jar and Windu.
