You're testing advertising emails for a bathing suit company and you test one version of the email in February and the other in May.
Potential bias:  If you're sending to people who live in a "winter" place, they are much more likely to be in the market for a 
bathing suit in May.
You open a clinic to treat anxiety and find that the people who visit show a higher rate of anxiety than the general population.
Potential bias:  People are going to the clinic to have their anxiety treated/people without anxiety don't go.  People generally 
have a higher rate of anxiety when visiting any doctor/medical facility. 
You launch a new ad billboard based campaign and see an increase in website visits in the first week.
Potential bias:  time of year - high travel times such as summers and holidays.
You launch a loyalty program but see no change in visits in the first week.
Potential bias:  time of year, rewards not motivating, not enough time to measure effect.
